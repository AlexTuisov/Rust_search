; Domain Overview and Improvements
; This domain models an industrial supply chain for sugar production, where raw cane is processed into refined sugar.
; It includes various stages such as production at mills, resource acquisition from farms or other mills, and
; transportation using trucks and cranes. The domain employs numeric functions and logical predicates to manage
; resource flows, operational states, and associated costs across the supply chain.
;
; I'm fixing the current domain based on the reference paper below and making changes to improve its optimality
; and clarity.
